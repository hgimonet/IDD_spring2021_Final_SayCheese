## What It Is

This is a collaborative drawing board. You can leave graduation messages for you peers at CT!
There are multiple boards around campus, and all of them are connected. Editing on one is editing them all!

Our aim was to create a fun interactive photo booth station for Cornell Tech grads. When these grads enter Tata, they
will see a large TV mounted to a wall that is capturing their faces and movements through the raspberry pi camera. They
will then be able to interact with the camera by placing emojis of their choice onto the photo and write messages on the
photo. We hope this interactive photo booth can be a fun way to bring people together.

## How to Use It

To get started, grab the **writing tool** (a green piece of chalk or highlighter). This is what you will use to interact
with the Board!

### Eraser Mode

To clear the entire board press 'e' on a laptop, or the eraser on the box.

### Drawing Mode

In drawing mode, the tool will leave a trace wherever it is detected. To have a break between lines or when writing
letters, hide the pen behind your hand and show it again to resume painting.

### Emojis Mode

Hold the green pen in place for 3 seconds to place an emoji. A countdown to 3 seconds will start whenever the pen is
detected in emoji mode. You can also hide the pen in your hand if you are still thinking about where to place the emoji.

To switch between emojis, press the capacitive buttons on the pi box, or press 'p' on a laptop.

## How To Make It

Each Pi must be equipped with a camera, a capacitive touch board, and connected to a screen. A box to contain the Pi can
be laser cut out of cardboard or wood. You will also need conductive wire or tape to connect the capacitive sensors to
the correct buttons on the box.

### Materials

For this project, you will need:

- A [Raspberry Pi](https://www.adafruit.com/product/)
- A 12-button [Capacitive Touch Sensor Breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4830)
- A screen
- Thin wood or cardboard
- Conductive wires or copper/aluminium tape
- A single bright-colored object to be detected by the camera

### Code

#### Running and Requirements

The only python required to run CollaBoard
is [CollaBoard/emoji_node_mqtt.py](https://github.com/hgimonet/IDD_spring2021_Final_SayCheese/blob/main/CollaBoard/emoji_node_mqtt.py)
. You will also need the emoji image files
in [CollaBoard/emojis](https://github.com/hgimonet/IDD_spring2021_Final_SayCheese/tree/main/CollaBoard/emojis)

Each computer running the code must be equipped with a camera or webcam.

To run the code on the pi, you must be on the GUI. Do access the pi with the GUI, you can VNC in. Once in
the `CollaBoard` folder, you can start the program with the following command:

```
python emoji_node_mqtt.py
```

#### Technical Details

### Making the Box

The files required to laser cut and engrave the box are
in [CollaBoard/Box_files](https://github.com/hgimonet/IDD_spring2021_Final_SayCheese/tree/main/CollaBoard/Box_files).
They were based on
this [box](https://3axis.co/laser-cut-wooden-box-with-sliding-lid-15x15x10-3mm-mdf-template-dxf-file/075yjn3o/).

To cut and assemble the box, follow [this tutorial]().

### Assembly

1. After putting all but the last faces of the box together, securely place the Pi inside.
2. Place the camera in the camera hole
3. Connect the emojis engravings to the capacitive sensor board with the wire or tape by passing it through the holes
   beneath the engraved emojis. The number lineup is the following:

| Number | Emoji |
|--------|-----------|
| 0 | Paintbrush Mode |
| 1 | grinning-face :grinning: |
| 2 | partying-face :partying_face:|
| 3 | shamrock :shamrock: |
| 4 | red-heart :hearts: |
| 5 | waving-hand :wave: |
| 6 | globe :earth_americas: |
| 7 | graduation-cap ðŸŽ“ |
| 8 | bottle-with-popping-cork :champagne: |
| 9 | balloon    :balloon: |
| 10 | light-bulb :bulb: |
| 11 | Eraser mode |

## Design Process

We iterated through multiple designs.

### Design 1: Distance Group Pictures

The aim of this device is to capture a group picture of people who are at different places in the world, in a city, or
in a room (depending on how many stations of this device we set up). When a user approaches a device station (perhaps
they are curious to see what the device is), they will be instructed to pose in a fun way. When the other device
stations that are set up have also been filled up by people, the camera will take a picture of each personâ€™s pose and
compile it into one group photo that will be printed at each camera station (like a polaroid). Due to potential privacy
concerns, the camera will only be taking the silhouette of each personâ€™s pose and fill it in with a fun emoji of the
userâ€™s choice. After the photo is taken, the user can then choose to either keep the photo or to discard it in a
waste/mini paper shredder bin placed next to the camera booth.

### Design 2: Towards Collaborative Art

One issue we struggled with in design 1 was privacy concerns. We wanted the camera to take pictures automatically, but
it seemed high-handed to do so in a public space without prior authorization. We played with several ideas to obscure
people's identifying features, but all of the solutions we considered (sihouetting figures, or face contouring) were
computationally demanding and difficult to code. This pushed us to consider other methods of expression: why not let
people write and leave emojis? We gave up on the idea of saving pictures, and focused on creating an interactive
messaging/artboard experience instead.

#### Paper prototype

Initially, we started our prototyping process in paper. The box had to be big enought to fit the raspberry pi with the camera and the capacity sensor connected to it. It needed to have a small hole and a support for the camera.
