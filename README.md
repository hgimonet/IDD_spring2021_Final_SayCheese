# Final Project for IDD
# CollaBoard, a collaborative drawing and emoji board!
by Hortense Gimonet, Irene Font Peradejordi, Brandt Beckerman, Rui Maki

## How it's made.

Each Pi must be equiped with a camera, a capacitive touch board, and connected to a screen.
A box to contain the Pi can be laser cut out of cardboard or wood. 
You will also need conductive wire or tape to connect the capacitive sensors to the correct buttons on the box.

### Code
The only python required to run CollaBoard is [CollaBoard/emoji_node_mqtt.py](). 
Each computer running the code must be equiped with a camera or webcam. 

### Making the Box
The files required to laser cut and engrave the box are in [CollaBoard/Box_files]().
